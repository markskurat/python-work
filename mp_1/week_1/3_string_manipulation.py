# with the input function, you can get input from users
# lets set the user inputs equal to variables, then use them appropriately
first_name = input("What is your first name?: ")

last_name = input("What is your last name?: ")

# since the values you input are set to variables, we can concatenate the strings
print("My first name is " + first_name + " and my last name is " + last_name)
